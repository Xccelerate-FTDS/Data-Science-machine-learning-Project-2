# E-commerce Price Tracker Project

Welcome to the E-commerce Price Tracker project repository. This project focuses on developing a tool to track and monitor price changes of products on e-commerce platforms over time.

## Project Description:
The E-commerce Price Tracker project aims to create a tool that allows users to monitor and analyze price variations of products on selected e-commerce websites. By scraping product price data and storing it in a structured format, users can track historical price trends and receive alerts for price fluctuations.

## Project Objectives:
1. Implement a web scraper using Beautiful Soup for extracting product price information.
2. Store historical price data in a database for tracking and analysis.
3. Develop a user-friendly interface for users to select products and view price histories.
4. Analyze price trends, provide alerts on price changes, and visualize fluctuations over time.

## Key Features:
- Web scraping of product prices from e-commerce platforms.
- Database storage for historical price tracking.
- User interface for selecting and monitoring products.
- Price change notifications and alerts for tracked items.
- Data visualization of price trends and fluctuations.

## Optional Enhancements:
- User authentication for personalized price tracking.
- Price prediction algorithms for forecasting future prices.
- Integration with email notifications for real-time alerts.
- Data analysis techniques for identifying pricing patterns and outliers.

## Technologies Used:
- Python for web scraping and data processing.
- Database management system for storing price data.
- Data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Repository Structure:
- `src/`: Contains project code files (scraper, database handling, user interface).
- `data/`: Optional folder for storing scraped price data.
- `README.md`: Project overview, details, and setup instructions.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes sensitive data and temporary files from version control.
