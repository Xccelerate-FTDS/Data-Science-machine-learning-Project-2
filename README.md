# Data Science and Machine Learning Project-2

Welcome to the Data Science and Machine Learning Projects Repository created to showcase hands-on project work in various data science domains. This repository contains branches for multiple data science projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and practical application development.

## Project Structure:

1. **E-commerce Price Tracker**:
   - A project to track and monitor price changes of products on e-commerce platforms over time.
2. **Real-time News Aggregator**:
   - A project to aggregate and display real-time news updates and articles from various sources.
3. **Job Listings Analysis**:
   - A project to analyze job listings data to identify job trends, demand, and other relevant information in the job market.
4. **Automated Travel Itinerary Planner**:
   - A project to automate the process of planning travel itineraries based on user preferences and travel data.
5. **Stock Market Trend Analysis** (DIY):
   - A project to analyze stock market trends, predict market movements, and provide insights for traders and investors.
6. **Real Estate Market Analysis** (DIY):
   - A project to analyze real estate market data, trends, and pricing information to assist buyers and sellers.
7. **Event Finder and Organizer** (DIY):
   - A project to discover local events, create event schedules, and manage event planning tasks.
8. **Historical Weather Data Analysis** (DIY):
   - A project to analyze historical weather data, identify patterns, and visualize weather trends over time.

## Repository Structure:

1. Each project has a dedicated branch within the repository for project-specific work.
2. The `src/` directory in each branch contains project code files, scripts, and utilities.
3. Data sources, datasets, or supplementary files are stored in the `data/` directory.
4. Project-specific README files provide detailed project descriptions, objectives, features, and guidelines for each project.

## Guidelines:

1. Students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and customize project implementations to enhance their data science skills.
2. Create individual repositories for each project on your GitHub account to showcase your project work.
3. Do not commit directly to this main repository. Save your project code and outputs in your individual project repositories.
